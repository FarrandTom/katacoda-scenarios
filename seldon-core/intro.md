##Â Introduction
In this scenario, you will deploy [Seldon Core](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/v1.1.0/) to a Kubernetes environment. 

You will then use Seldon Core to deploy and test a machine learning classifier- pre-trained on the Scikit-Learn [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html).

## Objectives
By the end of this hands-on tutorial you will understand: 
- What Seldon Core is
- How to install Seldon
- How to deploy and test machine learning models at scale on Kubernetes

## Pre-requisites
An understanding of Kubernetes terminology and concepts will be helpful!
