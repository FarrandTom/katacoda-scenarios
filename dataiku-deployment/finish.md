# Congratulations

You have successfully built a high performance resuable model server, which serves real time requests over both REST and gRPC.

This server can accept any PMML Dataiku artefact, and is built using the Seldon tooling.

After all that hard work, go get yourself a cup of tea and a biscuit!
