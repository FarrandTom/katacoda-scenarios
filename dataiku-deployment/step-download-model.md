Before you get going, you will need a Dataiku model to deploy! This tutorial makes use of a pre-trained Dataiku model saved in the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) format.

This model has been uploaded to a Google storage bucket where it can easily be pulled into your local Katacoda environment to begin working with. All you need to do is run the simple `wget` command below.

```(bash)
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/tom-seldon-examples/katacoda-scenarios/dataiku-model/high-revenue-prediction.pmml

```

You can validate that it has been successfully downloaded into your environment by clicking the refresh button in the top left of the editor pane.
